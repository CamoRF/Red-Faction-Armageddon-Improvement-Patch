----------------------------------------
To do
----------------------------------------

Balance
--------
* Increase alien spawns in singleplayer - 

* Nerf Queen (nerf queen beam in weapons.xtbl?) -
* Nerf hales walker hitpoints - 
* Nerf bullet sponge cultists; bleed out data in character.xtbl file, weapons can also be rebalanced - 
* Adjust rubberbounding file - 
* Balance salvage multipliers -
* Disable player flinch, landing animations, exo flinch and landing animations to compliment other fast movement changes? - 
* Add salvage drops to all structures - 
* Reduce revival speed time, it shouldn't be instant -
* Increase walking speed of Exo's - 
* Balance nanoforge_abilities.xtbl

Bugs
-----

* Remake mod using GOG files (cutscene files?) - 
* Fix typos in help messages like the one about middle clicking to repair "defend" and bad grammar with some others 
* Add custom strings when possible for map names and map descriptions
* Improve sledgehammer animations for Kara
* Delete all cutscene, story, quest, mission etc files from formatted and optimized (keep them organized in a sep folder but don't use them)

Features
--------
* Add other nanoforge abilities to infestation - 
* Test if adding new character entries with player rig allows them to work in MP - 
* Fix Kara animations: Line 4855: <Filename>ch_mar_ass_kara.rigx</Filename>, Line 4897:  <Animation_Sets> in character.xtbl - 
* Harder versions of maps using custom spawn_resource.xtbl entries, placeholder entry added. Dust survival already has a custom entry without the alien that still targets the objective - 
* Night version of Dust Survival -
* spawn_resource.xtbl might use spawn_group_human.xtbl, might be possible to add the grunts that 
don't destroy the buildings back to survival version of defense maps
* Figure out annoying alien names

Weapons
--------
* Fix missing full render image for Cultist Rifle in multiplayer (m16) -
* Decrease recharge rate on lava barge turret - 
* Decrease banshee pistols recoil and camera recoil very slightly - 
* Increase banshee pistols ammo
* Increase overheat rate for lava barge turret - 
* Increase banshee pistols damage -
* Cultist AR: Stronger with slower reload and more recoil - 
* Reduce firing delay on banshee pistols - 
* Increase repair grenade radius -
* Increase magnet gun pull radius -
* Revert no delay on repair grenade and slightly reduce the delay from vanilla values - 
* Add alien weapons in Ruin mode -
* Nerf LEO Assault Rifle, does way too much damage. Cooldown etc is good -
* Mr toots needs to overheat and cooldown -
* Buff plasma beam damage in multiplayer - 
* Fix missing full render image for Cultist Rifle in multiplayer (m16) -

-----
Test
-----
* The auto aim seems a bit aggressive with M+KB - wip
* Leo machine gun and rocket launchers need limited ammo to not be op (cheat weapons added to mp) - test
* Enforcer still feels off, needs faster firerate? - test
* Plasma cannon needs shorter charge up, more damage but maybe less ammo. It feels off - test
* Arc Welder needs more damage and less cooldown - test
* Convergence laser needs limited ammo instead of being infinite to not be op (cheat weapon added to mp) - test
* Rail driver sucks, it's useless against berserkers. Should two hit them but have limited ammo (power weapon) - test
* Lava barge turret needs limited ammo to not be op (cheat weapon added to mp) - test
* Buff charge launcher explosion - test
* Buff regular pistols: uncap firerate, increase clip and total ammo - test
* Arc welder, AR, shotgun, laser pistols all need changes from Infestation as a base - wip
* Decrease assault rifle recoil and camera recoil slightly in singleplayer - wip
* Increase assault rifle firerate in singleplayer - wip
* Dust survival might be broken on later waves, possibly due to the custom spawn_resource.xtbl and increased alien spawns not being complete - test

-----------
Low Priorty
------------
* Port DLC weapons to base game - assets ported into items.vpp_pc so far

* Remember to remove things like full ammo from pickups, all unlocks, upgrades costing nothing etc etc when balance is done -

* Power weapons in general should have half the ammo pickup of regular weapons -

* xDelta script to convert Steam to GOG version, it's a later version and less buggy, also fixes the issue with no crossplay implentation and adds discord api 

* Reduce memory pool usage: remove table templates, compress files that don't break (don't compress sounds, animations) - done, but files can be completely compressed when the mod is final; keep source files and fork it -

* Script that runs on startup (batch file) and backups "player_options.rfao_pc" - 

* AI upscale cutscenes -

* Change game icon  - 

* Update .exe with new version - 

* Remove the saving tool tip on startup - 

* Update changelog with detailed changes similar to the RF:G Community Patch - 

* Fix Mission: Cutscene after going down elevator threw me back to the main menu, was able to continue after reloading save

* Fix Mission: Cutscene after destroying the third generator clearing the path for the LAV in second DLC mission throws you back to the menu

* Fix Mission: Cutscene after falling down a hole in the first alien area after the radio static throws you back to the menu

* Fix Mission: Cutscene after entering the cargobay and defeating the walker, you press E to enter the terrformer and it throws you back to the main menu

* Fix Mission: Can't destroy red faction generator in path to war - 

* Fix FPS drops with weapons that cause large explosions? - 

* Apply tweaks to DLC -

Notes
----
* Memory pool limit is 12.3208 MB (12320768 bytes)
* Items.vpp_pc packs fine with DLC weapons added 
* objective_icon_labels.xtbl, missions.xtbl, quests.xtbl loading_screen.xtbl, cutscene.xtbl, cutscene_cameras.xtbl, loading_tip_text.xtbl and cutscenetable.xtbl possibly break cutscenes when formatted or optimized
* Refire delay only works in weapons.xtbl
- Acid Glob - Functional. Just needs weapon sounds.
- Acid Puke - Doesn't work.
- Acid Spit - Basically useless.
- Acid Thrower - Acts as a corrosive spray bottle. Kinda useless unless you're cleaning up debris.
- Alien Shotgun - Works but muzzle flash needs to be adjusted and add a cooldown and damage reduction.
- Ball Lightning Gun - Doesn't work.
- Behemoth Roar - Just fires a tiny tiny projectile that does basically nothing
- Big Acid Spit - Also useless.
- Bomb Lobber - Doesn't work.
- Boom Cannon - Functional. Just needs weapon sounds.
- Electrical Pulse Blast - Doesn't work.
- Gambit Gun - Doesn't work.

- Casual = Game Journalist Mode.
  Normal = Average. Not challenging or hard, not braindead.
  Hard = Challenging, but balanced and fair.
  Insane = A true challenge for pros. But beatable with experience.
