To do
----------------------------------------

* Add more weapons to ruin mode - done
* Cultist AR: Stronger with slower reload and more recoil
* Balance cheat weapons in infestation
* Increase jump height and movement speed - done
* Buff regular pistols: uncap firerate, increase clip and total ammo
* Buff charge launcher explosion 
* Change respawn back to 2 seconds for release build - done 
* Increase alien spawns in waves - up to wave 15 i think
* Decrease alien spawn delay - done 
* Balance total lives (calc: 12 / number of players) - done
* Revival tweaks: bleed out, invulnerability when spawning and after being revived etc - done
* Apply tweaks to DLC 
* Nerf Queen and Hale (nerf queen beam in weapons.xtbl?, nerf hales health?)
* Port DLC weapons to base game
* Add more characters to multiplayer Darius, Recon, Commando, Kara (there's some spawn resource files that need to be updated) - done 
* Buff rail driver
* Tweak vfx.xtbl - done 
* Tweak mp_difficulty overrides - done
* Remove the saving tool tip on startup
* Reduce bloom slightly 
* Increase shotgun camera recoil - done
* Can't destroy red faction generator in path to war, destruction settings, probably made the threshold for when something is destroyed too high
* Add other nanoforge abilities to infestation
* Kicks you back to main menu when starting a new game? (steam bug?)
* Test if adding new character entries with player rig allows them to work in MP
* Darius (Surface): Rename to "Darius"; Remove current: "Darius"
* Reduce bullet sponge cultists; bleed out data in character.xtbl file
* Harder versions of maps using custom spawn_resource.xtbl entries, placeholder entry added. Dust survival already has a custom entry without the alien that still targets the objective
* Fix Kara animations: Line 4855: <Filename>ch_mar_ass_kara.rigx</Filename>, Line 4897:  <Animation_Sets> in character.xtbl
* Reduce memory pool usage: remove table templates, compress files that don't break (don't compress sounds, animations) - done, but files can be completely compressed when the mod is final; keep source files and fork it
* Script that runs on startup (batch file) and backups "player_options.rfao_pc" -
* Change game icon 
* Update .exe with new version
* Fix broken level lighting: The Terraformer 1, Ice Mines 6 
* Update changelog
* Consistent weapon carry player movement speed

Notes
----
* Limit is 12.3208 MB 12320768 for misc.vpp_pc
* Items.vpp_pc packs fine with DLC weapons added 
* DLC weapons commented out in misc.vpp_pc as they crash game on startup currently, might be something to do with the bitmap entries that need to be replaced with placeholders as using broken bitmaps crashes multiplayer menu with characters too
