----------------------------------------
To do
----------------------------------------
* Increase alien spawns in waves - up to wave 15 i think
* Cultist AR: Stronger with slower reload and more recoil
* Apply tweaks to DLC -
* Nerf Queen and Hale (nerf queen beam in weapons.xtbl?, nerf hales health?) -
* Port DLC weapons to base game - assets ported, try replacing the bitmaps with placeholders in misc.vpp_pc
* Add other nanoforge abilities to infestation - 
* Switch to GOG misc and table.vpp_pc as base to fix bug with Steam version kicking you back to menu when starting a new game -
* Test if adding new character entries with player rig allows them to work in MP - 
* Reduce bullet sponge cultists; bleed out data in character.xtbl file - 
* Harder versions of maps using custom spawn_resource.xtbl entries, placeholder entry added. Dust survival already has a custom entry without the alien that still targets the objective - 
* Fix Kara animations: Line 4855: <Filename>ch_mar_ass_kara.rigx</Filename>, Line 4897:  <Animation_Sets> in character.xtbl - 
* Add more Nanoforge abilities to mutliplayer - 
* Continue tweaking bleedout and revive system - 
* Mr toots needs to overheat and cooldown - 
* Nerf hales walker hitpoints - 
* Dust survival might be broken on later waves, possibly due to the custom spawn_resource.xtbl and increased alien spawns not being complete -
* Nerf LEO Assault Rifle, does way too much damage. Cooldown etc is good -
* Lava gun might not have the cooldown changes anymore - 
* Adjust proxy limit in tweak_table.xtbl -
* Add alien weapons in Ruin mode -
* Add collide_as_mover_not_with_humans to gibs -
* Add gib chance to Assault Rifle, Rail Driver and other powerful guns if they are missing them -
* Optimize gib, decal and bullet mag despawns for multiplayer by making them despawn eventually (set limit) -
* Revert no delay on repair grenade and slightly reduce the delay from vanilla values - 
* Adjust rubberbounding file - 
* Balance salvage multipliers -
* Increase repair grenade radius -
* Increase magnet gun pull radius -
* Disable player flinch, landing animations, exo flinch and landing animations to compliment other fast movement changes? - 
* Decrease player jump delay - 
* Fix possible bugs with various weapons - 
* Add salvage drops to all structures - 
* Reduce revival speed time, it shouldn't be instant -
* Remove delay before using repair ability in SP - 
* Decrease assault rifle recoil and camera recoil slightly in singleplayer - 
* Increase assault rifle firerate in singleplayer - 
* Fix FPS drops with weapons that cause large explosions - 
* Buff plasma beam damage in multiplayer - 
* Increase ladder climbing speed even more (+2) or so -
* Increase overheat rate for lava barge turret - 
* Decrease recharge rate on lava barge turret - 
* Increase banshee pistols ammo
* Decrease banshee pistols recoil and camera recoil very slightly - 
* Increase banshee pistols damage -
* Remove firing delay on banshee pistols - 
* Increase walking speed of Exo's - 
* Fix Mission: Can't destroy red faction generator in path to war - 
* Carry over changes to shotgun and pistol to singleplayer and tweak as needed -
* Fix missing full render image for Cultist Rifle in multiplayer (m16) -
* Arc welder, AR, shotgun, laser pistols all need changes from Infestation as a base - 
* Increase alien spawns in singleplayer - 


-----
Test
-----
* Fix mission: one or more of the optimized files is breaking cutscenes - test
* Fix mission: cutscene after going down elevator threw me back to the main menu, was able to continue after reloading save - test
* Fix Mission: Cutscene after destroying the third generator clearing the path for the LAV in second DLC mission throws you back to the menu - test
* Fix Mission: Cutscene after falling down a hole in the first alien area after the radio static throws you back to the menu - test
* The auto aim seems a bit aggressive with M+KB - wip
* Leo machine gun and rocket launchers need limited ammo to not be op (cheat weapons added to mp) - test
* Enforcer still feels off, needs faster firerate? - test
* Plasma cannon needs shorter charge up, more damage but maybe less ammo. It feels off - test
* Arc Welder needs more damage and less cooldown - test
* Convergence laser needs limited ammo instead of being infinite to not be op (cheat weapon added to mp) - test
* Rail driver sucks, it's useless against berserkers. Should two hit them but have limited ammo (power weapon) - test
* Lava barge turret needs limited ammo to not be op (cheat weapon added to mp) - test
* Buff charge launcher explosion - test
* Buff regular pistols: uncap firerate, increase clip and total ammo - test

-----------
Low Priorty
------------
* Remember to remove things like full ammo from pickups, all unlocks, upgrades costing nothing etc etc when balance is done -
* Power weapons in general should have half the ammo pickup of regular weapons -
* xDelta script to convert Steam to GOG version, it's a later version and less buggy, also fixes the issue with no crossplay implentation and adds discord api 
* Reduce memory pool usage: remove table templates, compress files that don't break (don't compress sounds, animations) - done, but files can be completely compressed when the mod is final; keep source files and fork it -
* Script that runs on startup (batch file) and backups "player_options.rfao_pc" - 
* AI upscale cutscenes -
* Change game icon  - 
* Update .exe with new version - 
* Remove the saving tool tip on startup - 
* Update changelog with detailed changes similar to the RF:G Community Patch -

* Restore kill barriers, you can get stuck in singleplayer and infestation

Notes
----
* Memory pool limit is 12.3208 MB (12320768 bytes)
* Items.vpp_pc packs fine with DLC weapons added 
* quests.xtbl loading_screen.xtbl, cutscene.xtbl, cutscene_cameras.xtbl, loading_tip_text.xtbl and cutscenetable.xtbl possibly break cutscenes when formatted or optimized
* DLC weapons commented out in misc.vpp_pc as they crash game on startup currently, might be something to do with the bitmap entries that need to be replaced with placeholders as using broken bitmaps crashes multiplayer menu with characters too
