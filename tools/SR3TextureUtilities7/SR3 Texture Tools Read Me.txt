Saints Row the Third Texture Tools v7.0

by scanti



About:

These are a couple of tools that will allow you to unpack and repackage the
texture files in Saints Row 3. 

For those of you that like that sort of thing the programs source is in the source code
folder. For those that don't you can just delete it.



Usage:

To unpack a texture file:

SR3UnpackTextures [optional parameters] <<filename>.cpeg_pc or <filename>.cvbm_pc>>

You need to have the corresponding <filename>.gpeg_pc or <filename>.gvbm_pc file in
the same directory.

i.e.

SR3UnpackTextures ui_legal_pc.cpeg_pc

Plus the ui_legal_pc.gpeg_pc file has to be in the same directory as the ui_legal_pc.cpeg_pc file.

It will scan the file for any textures and save them under <texture name>.DDS

Sorry if you don't like DDS files but that's the format the game uses. However I am planning on
adding a feature that will save the files as tga files.

Optional parameters:

-o:<output directory>

	Save all the textures to a different directory than the direcory the peg files are in.

-silent
	Only display errors.

-fix
	Will attempt to extract from broken hex edited cvbm_pc files.


To repack a texture file:

SR3RepackTextures [optional parameters] <<filename>.cpeg_pc or <filename>.cvbm_pc>>

Your texture files must be in the same directory as the peg files unless you use the -i parameter.

I've changed the repacker so if a texture file is missing from the directory it will use the version that
is in the original peg file. i.e. you don't need a copy of all the textures in order to repack successfully.

Please note that this tool WILL OVERWRITE your existing cpeg_pc/cvbm_pc and gpeg_pc/gvbm_pc files.
So make sure you back them up before using this tool.

You can, if you want to, change the texture format of the unpacked texture files.

The DDS texture formats this tool supports are:

DXT1
DXT3
DXT5
R5G6B5
A1R5G5B5
A4R4G4B4
R8G8B8
A8R8G8B8

The engine does support a few other texture types but the game doesn't use them so I haven't included support for them.

Optional parameters:

-o:<output peg file>
	You can specify the name of the peg files you wish to create if you don't want to overwrite the existing peg files.
	The file name must end with cpeg_pc or cvbm_pc.

-i:<input texture directory>
	You can specify the directory that your texture files are in. If you omit this parameter it will look for the
	texture files in the same directory as your peg files.

-silent
	Only display errors.


To add a texture to a peg file:

SR3AddTexture [optional parameters] <peg filename>.cpeg <texture filename>.tga.dds

This will add the texture file to a cpeg container. The DDS can be any of the above formats. The peg archive will use
the <texture filename>.tga part of <texture filename>.tga.dds as the name of the texture. The utility doesn't check
for duplicate texture names and creating a peg file with duplicate names can result in undefined behaviour.

I've included blank cpeg_pc/gpeg_pc files so you can create an archive from scratch.

Optional parameters:

-silent
	Only display errors.

History

v7.0				SR3UnpackTextures can now extract broken cvbm_pc archives with -fix option.
				SR3RepackTextures doesn't need all the previously unpacked textures to repack.
				Added the SR3AddTexture utility.

v6.0				Started refactoring source code.
				Added new command line parameters.

v4.0				Will now extract 16 byte aligned textures correctly.
                                When packing textures it will align them to 16 bytes to optimise SR3 speed.
                                Changed the way the program gets the working directory. Should fix the extracting to My Documents error one
				user reported.
				Can now correctly pack 8 bit alpha only textures.

v3.0				Fixed problem with repacking 16 bit textures.

v2.0				Add repacking support.

v1.0				Initial version.

To do

Create tool for manipulating the texture flags.
Add support for tga files.
Add extract to global clipboard for SR3UnpackTextures.
Restructure code and create a peg class and create GUI version of tools.
